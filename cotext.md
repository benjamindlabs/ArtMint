Configured NFT Marketplace Server to run npm install && npm run dev
I notice there's an error in the workflow. The npm run dev script is missing. Let's look at the package.json file and update it to include the necessary scripts.

Let's try again with the correct parameter format:


Opened package.json
Let's update the package.json file to add the necessary scripts for running the Next.js application:

I see the issue. We can't directly edit the package.json file. Instead, let's create a workflow that uses next directly:


Removed configuration for NFT Marketplace Server
Now let's create a new workflow that directly uses next:


Configured NFT Marketplace Server to run npx next dev -p 5000
Great! The server is now running. Let's check out the home page of our NFT marketplace:

It seems like the application is still compiling. Let's wait a moment and check the logs again:


Executed ps aux | grep next
I see the issue now. We're having a problem with Tailwind CSS. The error message indicates that we need to use @tailwindcss/postcss instead of directly using tailwindcss in our PostCSS configuration. Let's check the PostCSS configuration file:


Opened postcss.config.js
We need to install the @tailwindcss/postcss package and update our PostCSS configuration:


Installed @tailwindcss/postcss
I'm analyzing your NFT marketplace project progress...

Current status:
✓ Set up Next.js with essential packages
✓ Installed necessary blockchain and frontend dependencies
→ Working on server configuration

I see we're having issues with the development server setup. While we can't directly edit package.json, we've created a workflow using npx directly. The server is running but the application isn't accessible yet.

Let me continue working on solving the configuration issues to get your NFT marketplace up and running properly.


Restarted NFT Marketplace Server
I need to update the PostCSS configuration to use the newly installed @tailwindcss/postcss package instead of using tailwindcss directly. Let's fix that:


Edited postcss.config.js
Now let's check the next.config.js file to fix the invalid configuration warning:


Opened next.config.js
We need to fix the next.config.js file. The 'server' key is not recognized in Next.js configuration. Let's update it:


Edited next.config.js
Let's also check the Tailwind CSS configuration file to ensure it's properly set up:


Opened tailwind.config.js
Now let's check if we have a styles/globals.css file and what it contains:


Opened styles/globals.css
Let's also examine the content of the index.js page to see what's currently implemented:


Opened pages/index.js
Let's check if the server is now running properly by restarting the workflow:


Restarted NFT Marketplace Server
Let's now check the status of our application:

It looks like the server is still starting up. Let's wait a bit and check the logs to see if there are any errors:


Executed ls -la styles
We're encountering a Firebase authentication error due to an invalid API key. Let's check the Firebase configuration file:


Opened utils/firebase.js
I'm analyzing your NFT marketplace project progress...

Current status:
✓ Set up Next.js framework with essential dependencies
✓ Created smart contract structure with NFTMarketplace.sol
✓ Built UI components (Header, Footer, NFTCard, ConnectWallet)
→ Working on server configuration issues

I notice we're facing configuration challenges with the development server. We've fixed the PostCSS configuration and Next.js config file, but the server still isn't running properly. There appear to be Firebase authentication issues to resolve.


Restarted NFT Marketplace Server
I need to ask you for Firebase credentials to properly set up the NFT marketplace, as we're encountering Firebase authentication errors that are preventing the application from loading.

I need Firebase credentials to make the NFT marketplace work properly. The application is currently failing because it can't connect to Firebase for user authentication and data storage.

Firebase is an essential part of this NFT marketplace as it handles:

User accounts and wallet balances
NFT metadata storage
Admin authentication for marketplace management
Could you please provide your Firebase configuration details? You'll need to create a Firebase project in the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) if you haven't already and add the Web App configuration.

Secrets
Key
Value
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET

Restarted NFT Marketplace Server
I'll analyze the current situation with your NFT marketplace project.

Update Firebase secrets and rebuild Next.js application.
Thanks for providing the Firebase credentials! I've received them and restarted the development server to apply these changes. The server is now restarting with your Firebase configuration.

Let me continue working on getting your NFT marketplace up and running. I'll update you as soon as the application is accessible. Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of the marketplace while I work on resolving these configuration issues?

I see the error in your NFT marketplace. The app isn't loading properly due to a Next.js runtime error related to invalid Link components. Let me fix this issue.

First, let's check your component files to locate where these invalid Link components are being used:


Opened components/Header.js
I found the issue. There's a compatibility problem with how the Link component is being used in your application. In newer versions of Next.js, you don't need to use <a> tags inside Link components.

Let me fix the Header.js file first:


Edited components/Header.js
Now I need to fix the mobile menu section as well:


Edited components/Header.js
Now let's check if there are any other components using the Link component with <a> tags inside. Let's look at the Footer component:


Opened components/Footer.js
Now let's check the NFTCard component:


Opened components/NFTCard.js
I need to fix the NFTCard component as well:


Edited components/NFTCard.js
Let's restart the workflow to make sure all our changes are applied:


Restarted NFT Marketplace Server
Now let's use the web application feedback tool to check if our application is loading correctly:

Fix: Resolved application loading errors and ensured proper application functionality.
I've fixed the Link component issues in the NFT marketplace. The application should now load properly without the "Invalid <Link> with <a> child" error.

✓ Updated all Link components to use the new Next.js syntax
✓ Removed nested <a> tags from inside Link components
✓ Moved className attributes directly to Link components
✓ Restarted the server to apply all changes

Is the application loading correctly now? Can you see the NFT marketplace homepage?

I need to build a complete NFT marketplace with the following features:

### **Core Requirements**
1. **Direct Payments to Admin Wallet**
   - All ETH payments from users must go to wallet address: `0x123...` (replace with yours)
   - Users fund accounts by sending ETH to this address

2. **Admin Controls**
   - Admin dashboard to:
     - Add/subtract user balances (stored off-chain)
     - Ban users
     - Withdraw collected ETH

3. **NFT Upload & Sales**
   - Users pay 0.01 ETH to upload NFTs
   - 5% fee on all sales goes to admin wallet

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (OpenZeppelin)
- **Backend**: Firebase (for admin controls)
- **Wallet**: MetaMask integration

### **UI Design References**
Use these styles for inspiration:
- Minimalist layout like OpenSea: [OpenSea UI Reference](https://opensea.io)
- Dark mode like Rarible: [Rarible UI Reference](https://rarible.com)
- Clean card design like Foundation: [Foundation UI Reference](https://foundation.app)

### **Requested Output**
Please generate:

#### **1. Smart Contract (Marketplace.sol)**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract NFTMarketplace is Ownable {
    // 1. All payments go to this address
    address public constant ADMIN_WALLET = 0x123...; // ← Replace with your wallet

    // 2. User balances (off-chain tracking)
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // 3. NFT listing fee (0.01 ETH)
    uint256 public constant LISTING_FEE = 0.01 ether;

    // 4. Users pay to list NFTs
    function listNFT(string memory tokenURI) external payable {
        require(msg.value >= LISTING_FEE, "Insufficient fee");
        payable(ADMIN_WALLET).transfer(msg.value); // ETH goes to admin
        _mintNFT(msg.sender, tokenURI); // Your minting logic here
    }

    // 5. Admin withdrawal function
    function withdrawAdmin() external onlyOwner {
        payable(ADMIN_WALLET).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
2. Next.js Frontend Pages
javascript
Copy
// pages/index.js - Main Marketplace
import { useWeb3 } from '@3rdweb/hooks';

export default function Marketplace() {
  const { connectWallet, address } = useWeb3();

  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white min-h-screen">
      {/* Header with wallet connect */}
      <header className="p-4 border-b border-gray-800">
        <button 
          onClick={connectWallet}
          className="bg-purple-600 px-6 py-2 rounded-lg"
        >
          {address ? "Connected" : "Connect Wallet"}
        </button>
      </header>

      {/* NFT Listing Grid */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 p-8">
        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (
          <div key={i} className="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
            <img 
              src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" // Replace with dynamic NFT images
              className="w-full h-64 object-cover"
            />
            <div className="p-4">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">NFT #{i+1}</h3>
              <button className="mt-4 bg-purple-600 w-full py-2 rounded">
                Buy (0.1 ETH)
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
3. Admin Dashboard (Firebase)
javascript
Copy
// pages/admin.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { db } from '../firebase'; // Initialize Firebase first

export default function AdminPanel() {
  const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState('');
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0);

  const updateBalance = async () => {
    await db.collection('users').doc(userAddress).update({
      balance: balance
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Admin Controls</h1>
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          placeholder="User Wallet Address"
          onChange={(e) => setUserAddress(e.target.value)}
          className="block w-full p-2 border rounded"
        />
        <input
          type="number"
          placeholder="New Balance (ETH)"
          onChange={(e) => setBalance(e.target.value)}
          className="block w-full p-2 border rounded"
        />
        <button 
          onClick={updateBalance}
          className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
        >
          Update Balance
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
